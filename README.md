# Fork Yeah!

Fork Yeah is a React App (Produced with Vite) that helps you find delicious meals to eat. It provides the user with the recipe for how to make the dish, and even an embedded Youtube video they can refer to in case they wanna watch someone else making it before they take it to the kitchen.

## Objective

We wanted to make a useful app anyone could use from the comfort of their home to make a nice meal they could surprise their guests with. A simple, yet powerful app, make possible thanks to the [Meal API](https://themealdb.com/api.php). 

## Getting Started

Our app is currently in the production stages. For now, just sit and wait. Fork Yeah will soon be available to the public.
